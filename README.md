## What?
Base code for my personal website, deployed via Github actions into Azure static storage with a Content Delivery Network sitting infront.

See the Terraform [infrastructure code](https://github.com/domroutley/website-infrastructure).

## Why?
I will be the first to admit that front end stuff isn't exactly my strong suit (I'm a pipelines, deployment orchestration, and infrastructure-as-code kinda person), so I'm trying to get better. And the only way I get better at things is to do them until I feel a bit more confident in them.

## Who?
Me, Dom.

## When?
Now hopefully. I personally think time travel is one of those technologies that, (if it exists) should not be used.
